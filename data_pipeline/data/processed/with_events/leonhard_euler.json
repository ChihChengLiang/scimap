      "Leonhard Euler (/ˈɔɪlər/ OY-lər;[b] 15 April 1707 – 18 September 1783) was a Swiss polymath who was active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician, geographer, and engineer. He founded the studies of graph theory and topology and made influential discoveries in many other branches of mathematics, such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and infinitesimal calculus. He also introduced much of modern mathematical terminology and notation, including the notion of a mathematical function.[3] He is known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory.[4] Euler has been called a \"universal genius\" who \"was fully equipped with almost unlimited powers of imagination, intellectual gifts and extraordinary memory\".[5] He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.",
      "Euler is credited for popularizing the Greek letter \n\n\n\nπ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n (lowercase pi) to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, as well as first using the notation \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n for the value of a function, the letter \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n to express the imaginary unit \n\n\n\n\n\n−\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {-1}}}\n\n, the Greek letter \n\n\n\nΣ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Sigma }\n\n (capital sigma) to express summations, the Greek letter \n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n (capital delta) for finite differences, and lowercase letters to represent the sides of a triangle while representing the angles as capital letters.[6] He gave the current definition of the constant \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n, the base of the natural logarithm, now known as Euler's number.[7] Euler made contributions to applied mathematics and engineering, such as his study of ships which helped navigation, his three volumes on optics contributed to the design of microscopes and telescopes, and he studied the bending of beams and the critical load of columns.[8]",
      "Euler is credited with being the first to develop graph theory (partly as a solution for the problem of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, which is also considered the first practical application of topology). He also became famous for, among many other accomplishments, solving several unsolved problems in number theory and analysis, including the famous Basel problem. Euler has also been credited for discovering that the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces minus the number of edges of a polyhedron equals 2, a number now commonly known as the Euler characteristic. In physics, Euler reformulated Isaac Newton's laws of motion into new laws in his two-volume work Mechanica to better explain the motion of rigid bodies. He contributed to the study of elastic deformations of solid objects. Euler formulated the partial differential equations for the motion of inviscid fluid,[8] and laid the mathematical foundations of potential theory.[5]"
