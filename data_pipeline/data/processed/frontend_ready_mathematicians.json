The eldest son of the renowned mathematician Leonhard Euler, he served as professor of physics at the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg and later as secretary of conferences overseeing the Academy's correspondence. His work Disquisitio de Causa Physica Electricitatis represented one of the earliest attempts to mathematize electrical theory through a mechanical framework based on compressible, elastic aether.",
          "Also known as Johann Albert Euler or John-Albert Euler, Johann Albrecht Euler was the first child born to the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), who had emigrated (for the first time) to Saint-Petersburg on 17 May 1727. His mother was Katharina Gsell (1707–1773) whose maternal grandmother was the famous scientific illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian (1647–1717). Katharina married Leonhard Euler on 7 January 1734, and Johann Albert would be the eldest of their 13 children (only 5 of whom survived childhood).[1]",
          "He spent his youth in Berlin from 1741 to 1766, after which he returned to Russia and was appointed Professor of Physics at the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in 1766. From 1769, he served as secretary of conferences, overseeing the Academy’s correspondence.[2]",
          "In 1754, Euler composed Disquisitio de Causa Physica Electricitatis (published 1757), in which he advanced a mechanical theory of electricity based on a compressible, elastic aether. Drawing on methods from hydrodynamics and differential calculus, he formulated equations linking the density and velocity of ether flowing through the pores of charged bodies, thereby providing a quantitative account of attraction and repulsion phenomena. Euler interpreted electrification as the expulsion of ether from a body's pores, with positive and negative states determined by the relative elasticity of ether inside the body compared to the surrounding medium. His approach represents one of the earliest attempts to mathematise electrical theory prior to the development of the action at a distance framework later formalised by Coulomb.[2]",
          "Although Euler's mechanistic and mathematical treatment of electricity was innovative, it attracted little contemporary attention—partly because it did not address the emerging phenomena of the Leyden jar and because he was based outside the principal research centres in London and Paris. Nevertheless, his work stands as a pioneering example of applying rigorous mathematical analysis to electrostatics and influenced subsequent debates on the nature of physical interactions in the late eighteenth century.[2]"

He founded the studies of graph theory and topology and made influential discoveries in many other branches of mathematics, such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and infinitesimal calculus. He also introduced much of modern mathematical terminology and notation, including the notion of a mathematical function.[3] He is known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory.[4] Euler has been called a \"universal genius\" who \"was fully equipped with almost unlimited powers of imagination, intellectual gifts and extraordinary memory\".[5] He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.",
          "Euler is credited for popularizing the Greek letter \n\n\n\nπ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n (lowercase pi) to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, as well as first using the notation \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n for the value of a function, the letter \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n to express the imaginary unit \n\n\n\n\n\n−\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {-1}}}\n\n, the Greek letter \n\n\n\nΣ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Sigma }\n\n (capital sigma) to express summations, the Greek letter \n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n (capital delta) for finite differences, and lowercase letters to represent the sides of a triangle while representing the angles as capital letters.[6] He gave the current definition of the constant \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n, the base of the natural logarithm, now known as Euler's number.[7] Euler made contributions to applied mathematics and engineering, such as his study of ships which helped navigation, his three volumes on optics contributed to the design of microscopes and telescopes, and he studied the bending of beams and the critical load of columns.[8]",
          "Euler is credited with being the first to develop graph theory (partly as a solution for the problem of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, which is also considered the first practical application of topology). He also became famous for, among many other accomplishments, solving several unsolved problems in number theory and analysis, including the famous Basel problem. Euler has also been credited for discovering that the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces minus the number of edges of a polyhedron equals 2, a number now commonly known as the Euler characteristic. In physics, Euler reformulated Isaac Newton's laws of motion into new laws in his two-volume work Mechanica to better explain the motion of rigid bodies. He contributed to the study of elastic deformations of solid objects. Euler formulated the partial differential equations for the motion of inviscid fluid,[8] and laid the mathematical foundations of potential theory.[5]"

          "Cramer was born on 31 July 1704 in Geneva, Republic of Geneva to Jean-Isaac Cramer, a physician, and Anne Mallet.[1] The progenitor of the Cramer family in Geneva was Jean-Ulrich Cramer, Gabriel's great-grandfather, who immigrated from Strasbourg in 1634.[2] Cramer's mother, a member of the Mallet family, was of Huguenot origin.[3] Cramer showed promise in mathematics from an early age. In 1722, aged 18, he received his doctorate from the Academy of Geneva, and at 20 he was made co-chair (along with Jean-Louis Calandrini)[a] of mathematics at the Academy.[1]",
          "He became the sole professor of mathematics in 1734 and was appointed professor of philosophy at the Academy in 1750.[1] Cramer was also involved in the politics of the Republic of Geneva, entering first the Council of Two Hundred in 1734 then the Council of Sixty in 1750.[1] He was a member of the science academies of Bologna, Lyon, and Montpellier, as well as a foreign member of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin.[1] Cramer died on 4 January 1752 at Bagnols-sur-Cèze while traveling in southern France to restore his health.[1]",
          "In 1728, Cramer proposed a solution to the St. Petersburg Paradox that came very close to the concept of expected utility theory given ten years later by Daniel Bernoulli. He did extensive travel throughout Europe in the late 1730s, which greatly influenced his works in mathematics.",
          "Cramer published his best-known work in his forties. This included his treatise on algebraic curves (1750). It contains the earliest demonstration that a curve of the n-th degree is determined by n(n + 3)/2 points on it, in general position (see Cramer's theorem (algebraic curves)). This led to the misconception that is Cramer's paradox, concerning the number of intersections of two curves compared to the number of points that determine a curve."

          "Johann III Bernoulli (also known as Jean; 4 November 1744 in Basel – 13 July 1807 in Berlin), grandson of Johann Bernoulli and son of Johann II Bernoulli, was a Swiss mathematician, philosopher, astronomer and geographer, known around the world as a child prodigy.[1]",
          "He studied at Basel and at Neuchâtel, and when thirteen years of age took the degree of doctor in philosophy. When he was fourteen, he got the degree of master of jurisprudence.[1] At nineteen he was appointed astronomer royal of Berlin. A year later, he reorganized the astronomical observatory at the Berlin Academy.[1] Some years after, he visited Germany, France and England, and subsequently Italy, Courland, Russia and Poland. His travel accounts were of great cultural and historical importance (1772–1776; 1777–1779; 1781).[1][2] He wrote about Kashubians.",
          "On his return to Berlin he was appointed director of the mathematical department of the academy. His writings consist of travels and astronomical, geographical and mathematical works. In 1774 he published a French translation of Leonhard Euler’s Elements of Algebra. He contributed several papers to the Academy of Berlin, and in 1774 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",
          "He was entrusted with the administration of Bernoulli family's mathematical estate.[1] The bulk of the correspondence was sold to the Swedish Academy where it was overlooked until rediscovered by Hugo Gyldén at the Stockholm Observatory in 1877.[1] He is one of the last notable members of the Bernoulli family."

He made significant contributions to the fields of analysis, number theory, and both classical and celestial mechanics.",
          "In 1766, on the recommendation of Leonhard Euler and d'Alembert, Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, Prussia, where he stayed for over twenty years, producing many volumes of work and winning several prizes of the French Academy of Sciences. Lagrange's treatise on analytical mechanics (Mécanique analytique, 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1788–89), which was written in Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since Isaac Newton and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century.",
          "In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to Paris and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He remained in France until the end of his life. He was instrumental in the decimalisation process in Revolutionary France, became the first professor of analysis at the École Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794, was a founding member of the Bureau des Longitudes, and became Senator in 1799.",
          "Lagrange was one of the creators of the calculus of variations, deriving the Euler–Lagrange equations for extrema of functionals. He extended the method to include possible constraints, arriving at the method of Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange invented the method of solving differential equations known as variation of parameters, applied differential calculus to the theory of probabilities and worked on solutions for algebraic equations. He proved that every natural number is a sum of four squares. His treatise Theorie des fonctions analytiques laid some of the foundations of group theory, anticipating Galois. In calculus, Lagrange developed a novel approach to interpolation and Taylor's theorem. He studied the three-body problem for the Earth, Sun and Moon (1764) and the movement of Jupiter's satellites (1766), and in 1772 found the special-case solutions to this problem that yield what are now known as Lagrangian points. Lagrange is best known for transforming Newtonian mechanics into a branch of analysis, Lagrangian mechanics. He presented the mechanical \"principles\" as simple results of the variational calculus.",
          "In appearance he was of medium height, and slightly formed, with pale blue eyes and a colourless complexion. In character he was nervous and timid, he detested controversy, and to avoid it willingly allowed others to take the credit for what he had himself done."

          "Alexis Claude Clairaut (/klɛərˈroʊ/;[2] French: [alɛksi klod klɛʁo]; 13 May 1713 – 17 May 1765) was a French mathematician, astronomer, and geophysicist. He was a prominent Newtonian whose work helped to establish the validity of the principles and results that Sir Isaac Newton had outlined in the Principia of 1687. Clairaut was one of the key figures in the expedition to Lapland that helped to confirm Newton's theory for the figure of the Earth. In that context, Clairaut worked out a mathematical result now known as \"Clairaut's theorem\". He also tackled the gravitational three-body problem, being the first to obtain a satisfactory result for the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit. In mathematics he is also credited with Clairaut's equation and Clairaut's relation.",
          "Clairaut was born in Paris, France, to Jean-Baptiste and Catherine Petit Clairaut. The couple had 20 children, however only a few of them survived childbirth.[3] His father taught mathematics. Alexis was a prodigy – at the age of ten he began studying calculus. At the age of twelve he wrote a memoir on four geometrical curves and under his father's tutelage he made such rapid progress in the subject that in his thirteenth year he read before the Académie française an account of the properties of four curves which he had discovered.[4] When only sixteen he finished a treatise on Tortuous Curves, Recherches sur les courbes a double courbure, which, on its publication in 1731, procured his admission into the Royal Academy of Sciences, although he was below the legal age as he was only eighteen. He gave a path-breaking formulae called the distance formulae which helps to find out the distance between any 2 points on the cartesian or XY plane.",
          "Clairaut was unmarried, and known for leading an active social life.[3] His growing popularity in society hindered his scientific work: \"He was focused,\" says Bossut, \"with dining and with evenings, coupled with a lively taste for women, and seeking to make his pleasures into his day to day work, he lost rest, health, and finally life at the age of fifty-two.\" Though he led a fulfilling social life, he was very prominent in the advancement of learning in young mathematicians.",
          "He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 27 October 1737.[5]",
          "In 1736, together with Pierre Louis Maupertuis, he took part in the expedition to Lapland, which was undertaken for the purpose of estimating a degree of the meridian arc.[6] The goal of the excursion was to geometrically calculate the shape of the Earth, which Sir Isaac Newton theorised in his book Principia was an ellipsoid shape. They sought to prove if Newton's theory and calculations were correct or not. Before the expedition team returned to Paris, Clairaut sent his calculations to the Royal Society of London. The writing was later published by the society in the 1736–37 volume of Philosophical Transactions.[7] Initially, Clairaut disagrees with Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In the article, he outlines several key problems that effectively disprove Newton's calculations, and provides some solutions to the complications. The issues addressed include calculating gravitational attraction, the rotation of an ellipsoid on its axis, and the difference in density of an ellipsoid on its axes.[7] At the end of his letter, Clairaut writes that:"

He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics, especially fluid mechanics, and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics.[2] His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli's principle, a particular example of the conservation of energy, which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the carburetor and the aeroplane wing.[3][4]",
          "Daniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen, in the Netherlands, into a family of distinguished mathematicians.[5] The Bernoulli family came originally from Antwerp, at that time in the Spanish Netherlands, but emigrated to escape the Spanish persecution of the Protestants. After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel, in Switzerland.",
          "Daniel was the son of Johann Bernoulli (one of the early developers of calculus) and a nephew of Jacob Bernoulli (an early researcher in probability theory and the discoverer of the mathematical constant e).[5] He had two brothers, Niklaus and Johann II. Daniel Bernoulli was described by W. W. Rouse Ball as \"by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis\".[6]",
          "He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father. Both of them entered and tied for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris. Johann banned Daniel from his house, allegedly being unable to bear the \"shame\" of Daniel being considered his equal. Johann allegedly plagiarized key ideas from Daniel's book Hydrodynamica in his book Hydraulica and backdated them to before Hydrodynamica.[citation needed] Daniel's attempts at reconciliation with his father were unsuccessful.[7]",
          "When he was in school, Johann encouraged Daniel to study business citing poor financial compensation for mathematicians. Daniel initially refused but later relented and studied both business and medicine at his father's behest under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately.[7] Daniel studied medicine at Basel, Heidelberg, and Strasbourg, and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721."

          "Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert[a] (/ˌdæləmˈbɛər/ DAL-əm-BAIR;[1] French: [ʒɑ̃ batist lə ʁɔ̃ dalɑ̃bɛʁ]; 16 November 1717 – 29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, mechanician, physicist, philosopher, and music theorist. Until 1759 he was, together with Denis Diderot, a co-editor of the Encyclopédie.[2] D'Alembert's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him.[3][4][5] The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's equation, and the fundamental theorem of algebra is named after d'Alembert in French.",
          "Born in Paris, d'Alembert was the natural son of the writer Claudine Guérin de Tencin and the chevalier Louis-Camus Destouches, an artillery officer. Destouches was abroad at the time of d'Alembert's birth. Days after birth his mother left him on the steps of the Saint-Jean-le-Rond de Paris church. According to custom, he was named after the patron saint of the church. D'Alembert was placed in an orphanage for foundling children, but his father found him and placed him with the wife of a glazier, Madame Rousseau, with whom he lived for nearly 50 years.[6] She gave him little encouragement. When he told her of some discovery he had made or something he had written she generally replied,",
          "You will never be anything but a philosopher—and what is that but an ass who plagues himself all his life, that he may be talked about after he is dead.[7]",
          "Destouches secretly paid for the education of Jean le Rond, but did not want his paternity officially recognised.",
          "D'Alembert first attended a private school. The chevalier Destouches left d'Alembert an annuity of 1,200 livres on his death in 1726. Under the influence of the Destouches family, at the age of 12 d'Alembert entered the Jansenist Collège des Quatre-Nations (the institution was also known under the name \"Collège Mazarin\"). Here he studied philosophy, law, and the arts, graduating as baccalauréat en arts in 1735."

          "Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace (/ləˈplɑːs/; French: [pjɛʁ simɔ̃ laplas]; 23 March 1749 – 5 March 1827) was a French polymath, a scholar whose work has been instrumental in the fields of physics, astronomy, mathematics,  engineering, statistics, and philosophy. He summarized and extended the work of his predecessors in his five-volume Mécanique céleste (Celestial Mechanics) (1799–1825). This work translated the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus, opening up a broader range of problems. Laplace also popularized and further confirmed Sir Isaac Newton's work.[2] In statistics, the Bayesian interpretation of probability was developed mainly by Laplace.[3]",
          "Laplace formulated Laplace's equation, and pioneered the Laplace transform which appears in many branches of mathematical physics, a field that he took a leading role in forming. The Laplacian differential operator, widely used in mathematics, is also named after him. He restated and developed the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the Solar System and was one of the first scientists to suggest an idea similar to that of a black hole,[4] with Stephen Hawking stating that \"Laplace essentially predicted the existence of black holes\".[1] He originated Laplace's demon, which is a hypothetical all-predicting intellect. He also refined Newton's calculation of the speed of sound to derive a more accurate measurement.[5]",
          "Laplace is regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time. Sometimes referred to as the French Newton or Newton of France, he has been described as possessing a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of almost all of his contemporaries.[6] He was Napoleon's examiner when Napoleon graduated from the École Militaire in Paris in 1785.[7]  Laplace became a count of the Empire in 1806 and was named a marquis in 1817, after the Bourbon Restoration.",
          "Some details of Laplace's life are not known, as records of it were burned in 1925 with the family château in Saint Julien de Mailloc, near Lisieux, the home of his great-great-grandson the Comte de Colbert-Laplace. Others had been destroyed earlier, when his house at Arcueil near Paris was looted in 1871.[8]",
          "Laplace was born in Beaumont-en-Auge, Normandy on 23 March 1749, a village four miles west of Pont l'Évêque. According to W. W. Rouse Ball,[9] his father, Pierre de Laplace, owned and farmed the small estates of Maarquis. His great-uncle, Maitre Oliver de Laplace, had held the title of Chirurgien Royal. It would seem that from a pupil he became an usher in the school at Beaumont; but, having procured a letter of introduction to d'Alembert, he went to Paris to advance his fortune. However, Karl Pearson[8] is scathing about the inaccuracies in Rouse Ball's account and states:"

          "Johann Heinrich Lambert (German: [ˈlambɛɐ̯t]; French: Jean-Henri Lambert; 26 or 28 August 1728 – 25 September 1777) was a polymath from the Republic of Mulhouse, at that time allied to the Swiss Confederacy, who made important contributions to the subjects of mathematics, physics (particularly optics), philosophy, astronomy and map projections.",
          "Lambert was born in 1728 into a Huguenot family in the city of Mulhouse[1], nowadays in  Alsace, France, at that time a city-state allied to the Swiss Confederacy.[2]  Some sources give 26 August as his birth date and others 28 August.[3][4][1]  Leaving school at 12, he continued to study in his free time while undertaking a series of jobs.  These included assistant to his father (a tailor), a clerk at a nearby iron works, a private tutor, secretary to the editor of Basler Zeitung and, at the age of 20, private tutor to the sons of Count Salis in Chur.  Travelling Europe with his charges (1756–1758) allowed him to meet established mathematicians in the German states, The Netherlands, France and the Italian states. On his return to Chur he published his first books (on optics and cosmology) and began to seek an academic post. After a few short posts he was rewarded (1763) by an invitation to a position at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he gained the sponsorship of Frederick II of Prussia, and became a friend of Leonhard Euler. In this stimulating and financially stable environment, he worked prodigiously until his death in 1777.[1]",
          "Lambert was the first to systematize and popularize the use of hyperbolic functions into trigonometry. He credits the previous works of Vincenzo Riccati and Daviet de Foncenex. Lambert developed exponential expressions and identities and introduced the modern notation.[5] Lambert also made conjectures about non-Euclidean space.",
          "Lambert is credited with the first proof that π is irrational using a generalized continued fraction for the function tan x.[6] Euler believed the conjecture but could not prove that π was irrational, and it is speculated that Aryabhata also believed this, in 500 CE.[7] Lambert also devised theorems about conic sections that made the calculation of the orbits of comets simpler.",
          "Lambert devised a formula for the relationship between the angles and the area of hyperbolic triangles. These are triangles drawn on a concave surface, as on a saddle, instead of the usual flat Euclidean surface. Lambert showed that the angles added up to less than π (radians), or 180°. The defect (amount of shortfall) increases with area. The larger the triangle's area, the smaller the sum of the angles and hence the larger the defect C△ = π — (α + β + γ). That is, the area of a hyperbolic triangle (multiplied by a constant C) is equal to π (radians), or 180°, minus the sum of the angles α, β, and γ. Here C denotes, in the present sense, the negative of the curvature of the surface (taking the negative is necessary as the curvature of a saddle surface is by definition negative). As the triangle gets larger or smaller, the angles change in a way that forbids the existence of similar hyperbolic triangles, as only triangles that have the same angles will have the same area. Hence, instead of the area of the triangle's being expressed in terms of the lengths of its sides, as in Euclidean geometry, the area of Lambert's hyperbolic triangle can be expressed in terms of its angles."
