      "Alexis Fontaine, known as Alexis Fontaine des Bertins (13 August 1704 – 21 August 1771) was a French mathematician. He was a patron and teacher of Jean-Jacques de Marguerie.",
      "Fontaine was born in Claveyson.  He first got a taste for maths by reading the Géométrie de l'infini of Fontenelle and gave solutions to the problems of the tautochrone curve, the brachistochrone curve and orthogonal trajectories. \nHe was elected a member of the Académie des sciences in 1733.  He died, aged 67, in Cuiseaux.",
