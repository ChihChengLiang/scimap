      "Thomas Fuller (1710 – December 1790), also known as \"Negro Demus\" and the \"Virginia Calculator\", was an enslaved African renowned for his mathematical abilities.[1]",
      "Born on the  African continent, likely somewhere between present-day Liberia and Benin,[2] Fuller was kidnapped and shipped to America in 1724, at the age of 14. He became enslaved by Elizabeth Cox of Alexandria, Virginia.[3] Despite his mathematical skill, Fuller was illiterate.[4] Ethnomathematics researcher Ron Eglash theorizes that Fuller may have been Bassari, comparing his abilities to their mathematical traditions.[5] Before colonialism, the Bassari used to have \"specialists who were trained in the memorization of sums\".[5]",
      "Stories of his mathematical achievements spread through the East Coast of the United States and reached as far as France and Germany, becoming fuel for the abolitionist movement.[6]",
      "When Fuller was about 70 years old, William Hartshorne and Samuel Coates, members of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society (PAS), heard about Fuller's \"extraordinary powers in arithmetic.\"[7] The pair stopped their travels to investigate Fuller.[7] Benjamin Rush, physician and Founding Father, had sought proof of Black intelligence, through the lens of \"scientific achievement\", to bolster antislavery causes [8]. Through his membership in PAS, Rush was acquainted with Hartshorne and Coates and reported on their interview of Fuller in the Columbian Magazine.[6][9] In this report, Rush stressed the credibility of Hartshorne and Coates.[2] Rush retold how Hartshorne and Coates tested Fuller's mathematical abilities as follows: [2]",
      "First. Upon being asked, how many seconds there are in a year and a half, he answered in about two minutes, 47,304,000."
