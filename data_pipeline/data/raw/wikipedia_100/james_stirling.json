      "James Stirling (11 May[4] O.S. 1692,[5][6] Garden, Stirlingshire â€“ 5 December 1770, Edinburgh) was a Scottish mathematician. He was nicknamed \"The Venetian\".",
      "The Stirling numbers, Stirling permutations, and Stirling's approximation are named after him. He also proved the correctness of Isaac Newton's classification of cubic plane curves.[7]",
      "Stirling was born on 11 May 1692[8] O.S. at Garden House near Stirling, the third son of Archibald Stirling (1651-1715) and Anna Hamilton, and grandson of Archibald Stirling, Lord Garden, (1617-1668).[9]",
      "At 18 years of age he went to Balliol College, Oxford, where, chiefly through the influence of the Earl of Mar, he was nominated in 1711 to be one of Bishop Warner's exhibitioners (or Snell exhibitioner) at Balliol. In 1715 he was expelled on account of his correspondence with his cousins, who were members of the Keir and Garden families, who were noted Jacobites, and had been accessory to the \"Gathering of the Brig o' Turk\" in 1708.",
      "From Oxford he made his way to Venice, where he occupied himself as a professor of mathematics. In 1717 appeared his Lineae tertii ordinis Newtonianae, sive . . . (8vo, Oxford). While in Venice, also, he communicated, through Isaac Newton, to the Royal Society a paper entitled \"Methodus differentialis Newtoniana illustrata\" (Phil. Trans., 1718). Fearing assassination on account of having discovered a trade secret of the glassmakers of Venice, he returned with Newton's help to London about the year 1725."
