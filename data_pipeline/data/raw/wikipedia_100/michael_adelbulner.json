      "Michael A. Adelbulner (February 3, 1702 – June 21, 1779) was a German mathematician, physicist, physician, and astronomer. He was born at Nürnberg and died in Altdorf bei Nürnberg.",
      "His claim to fame resides in his having started with Anders Celsius in 1733 a journal of astronomy called \"Mitteilungsblatt zur Förderung der Astronomie / Commercium litterarium ad astronomiae incrementum\", announcing the principal celestial phenomena, and analyzing new publications. This journal enjoyed much reputation in its day. Thirty-four numbers were published.",
