      "Fortunato of Brescia (1701–1754) was an Italian Minorite friar, mathematician, philosopher and anatomist.",
      "He was born at Brescia, and received the religious habit in 1718. A philosopher and theologian, Fortunato was also renowned for his studies in the natural sciences. He was secretary general of his order, and stood in high favour at the Bourbon court of Spain. He died in Madrid.",
      "He was among the first to bring together the teachings of Scholastic philosophy and the discoveries of the physical sciences. His scientific work is rendered important by his extensive use of the microscope, in which he followed the lead of Malpighi. Avoiding the then prevalent discussions on vitalism, he devoted himself to a positive study of the problems of natural science.",
      "Convinced that a knowledge of microscopic anatomy is the key to the secrets of nature, he deemed two things to be of prime importance:",
      "This view, clear in the works of Fortunato, has prevailed in pathology and physiology, and in this sense Fortunato was a pioneer. He confined himself to the microscopic study of the parts of the organism, and in this way succeeded in classifying tissues and organs many years before Bichat (1800). Fortunato was the first to distinguish between tissues and organs."
